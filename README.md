### Welcome to my GitHub
# My names Steven.

I'm an entry level software developer looking to expand my skills on various topics. I would argue I'm interested in many different topics, 
and I am constantly striving to learn more and brush up on my prior skills. <br>

# My Main Topics of Interest 
- Machine Learning
- Numerical Analysis
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- CUDA

# Currently Learning
As of August 2021, I am going to start working on the [Propulsion](https://github.com/rottenroddan/Propulsion) project again. It is a project that I started with
learning how to use CUDA in c++, but since then has evolved into a numerical library. It mainly handles dynamically creating Matrices/Tensors and performing various 
numerical operations on these objects using CUDA or your cpu. Other than that, I have been dabbling with AngularJS and NodeJS. 

# Future Colab?
I would love to collaborate on a CUDA or even an OpenCL project. I don't have a formal education with either yet, but I do have a strong interest in mostly
anything performance related. Also interested in using Tensorflow in a future project as well. 

# Reach Me Via Email
